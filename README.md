# SampleCounter

This macro-enabled Excel workbook generates unique numeric identifiers for all items listed in an Excel table. It generates strings and string ranges. EXAMPLE: A single sample generates the next number as the sample identifier. For quantities of more than one, it generates a range "X to Y" string. You can skip the number assignment by entering a zero or leaving a cell blank.
